# Google Chrome Auto Tab Switcher with Auto Refresh Extension

This extension switches tabs at a user-defined interval and then refreshes the tab. This works on the window that you started the tab switching on, and you can use other windows without interruption. You can set the switching time in seconds, the color of the countdown badge, and show/hide the badge.

This is on the Google Chrome Extension store currently for free.

100% open source. Extend or modify the usage of it as much as you want.
